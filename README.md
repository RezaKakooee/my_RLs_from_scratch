# Implementing DRL algorithms in Python from scratch

## Goal
In this repository, my goal is to implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms in Python from scratch.

## Note
These codes are proper to be used for educational purposes. So, RL practitioners might use other RL libraries such as RLlib, StableBaselines, TF-Agents, etc.
For writing these codes, I use different resources that will be added to the repo later.

## Extra
I will also add some new environment to the repo. 

## Contact
Please feel free to use the codes, and let me know if you see any bugs or mistakes.
You can easily find me via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reza-kakooee/).
